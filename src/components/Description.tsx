      <h2>The 8th edition of the International Taco Bell 50k Ultramarathon</h2>
      <p>
        It has been described as Urban Legend. More mysterious and barking
        spiders than the Barkley Marathons. The International Taco Bell 50k
        boasts a higher DNF rate than the famed Leadville 100 Trail Race. The
        lore of the genesis for the race dates back to a hot tub, stoic Russian,
        short king from New York and Susie. The race has been held annually in
        Denver, Colorado in early October, which coincidentally coincides with
        International Taco Day. It is a good idea to engage in gastric training.
        If you complete the challenge, you will be deemed a SURVIVOR, revered
        and heckled for life!
